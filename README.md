# DriveTest_Portal

This project is web-based application that lets users schedule driving exams. There are three panels on the portal: user, admin, and examiner. 

The administrator can schedule driving test appointment times and dates using the admin interface. By doing this, customers can make test reservations based on the dates and appointment times that are available.

The driving test booking user panel is intended for users. Users can choose a convenient time slot, update their profile details, and select the type of test they want to take - for example, a G or G2 driving test.

The examiner panel is made for the examiners that administer and grade driving examinations. Examiners can amend driving test results and give feedbacks to the users.

All the data pertaining to driving tests is managed and stored using MongoDB.
MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that provides flexibility and scalability to the project.
